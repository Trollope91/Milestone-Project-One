The website is designed to be simple and effective displaying competent use of HTML and CSS with attention to UI and UX, it will be responsive and adapt to all resolutions shifting layout and size to accomodate mobile, tablet and desktop. the page is designed in a one page layout with smooth scrolling and animation to denote the links and interactive elements on the page.

## Wireframes

### Changes

Initially the site was to contain a dedicated contact me section but I thought with the links in the footer I could add a modal to the intial home page for a better use of space and look overall.

### Colors

Main colours used in a project:
Text in paragraphs: Azure
Brand and headers: rgb(161, 152, 17,)


### Fonts

## Issues found during site development

I had issues targeting the specific parts of bootstrap which lead to a few issues that I rectified by different means 

when trying to change the brand name to the site specific colors and add an animation on hover I found the only way to rectify it was to use inline styling to circumvent the issue

`style="color: rgb(161, 152, 17); font-size: xx-large;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#d4c715'" onmouseout="this.style.color='rgb(161, 152, 17)`

* ####

when attempting to remove the stock boot strap color schemes with my own I decided to use the built in (btn-dark) feature to create a cohesive and intentional feel to the design.

## Copying the repository

A user can make a local copy of my repository by going to the GitHub repository page of my project and clicking on the "Code" button which will open a dropdown menu, select the protocol (HTTPS or SSH) for the clone URL and copy it to the clipboard.
Open a terminal on their local machine and navigate to the directory where they want to store the project then type the command "git clone" followed by the URL they copied in step 3, and press Enter.
Wait for the cloning process to complete.
